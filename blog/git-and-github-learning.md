Git and GitHub – My Learning Notes 

🔹Introduction

  Git and GitHub are essential tools for every developer. Git helps us track changes in our code, while GitHub allows us to store our projects online and collaborate with others.
  This document contains my personal notes and understanding of Git and GitHub as a beginner.

🔹What is Git?

  Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

🔹Why Git is important

  Keeps track of every change in files

  Allows reverting to previous versions

  Supports teamwork without overwriting code

  Works offline on your local machine

 🔹What is GitHub?

   GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.

 🔹Why GitHub is used

  Stores projects online

  Helps in collaboration with teams

  Shows project history and contributions

  Useful for portfolio and interviews

👉 Git = tool
👉 GitHub = platform

  🔹Basic Git Workflow

  Create or modify files

  Add files to staging area

  Commit changes with a message

  Push changes to GitHub

  🔹Common Git Commands
  
Check Git version
git --version

Initialize a repository
git init

Check file status
git status

Add files to staging area
git add .

Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Connect local repo to GitHub
git remote add origin <repository-url>

Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

🔹What is a Repository?

A repository (repo) is a folder that contains:

Project files

Git history

Configuration files

Repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (on GitHub).

🔹What is README.md?

README.md is the main documentation file of a repository.

It usually contains:

Project name

Description

How to use the project

Technologies used

GitHub automatically displays this file on the repository home page.
